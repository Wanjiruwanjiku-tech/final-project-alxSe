In VF, the ventricles quiver instead of contracting properly, resulting in no effective blood flow. VT is a rapid heart rhythm originating from the ventricles, which can lead to the heart being unable to pump blood efficiently. Both conditions are considered shockable rhythms because they can potentially be corrected with defibrillation, a process where an electric shock is delivered to the heart to restore a normal rhythm. Immediate recognition and prompt defibrillation are crucial in improving the chances of survival for patients experiencing VF or VT.",

Asystole, also known as flatline, is the absence of any electrical activity in the heart, resulting in no heartbeat and no circulation of blood. PEA occurs when there is electrical activity on the ECG, but the heart is not pumping effectively, leading to no palpable pulse. These rhythms are not amenable to defibrillation, and survival depends on prompt recognition and treatment of the underlying causes.",
